CTD Report
	The first part of this analysis looks at the frequency of dives across the shallow and deep profilers. One would assume that the deep profiler would run for fewer dives since it would have more distance to cover. Below are the Coastal Endurance Oregon Offshore Cabled Shallow and Deep Profiler Moorings.
 
 
	The graphs above show the deep profiler having more dives than the shallow profile, which does not match our initial prediction. To get a better understanding of what was going on, I looked at some of the additional data that was requested.
 
 
 
 
	Looking at some of the additional data collected, it appears that the initial graphs were an anomaly. Given the greater distance these CTDs must travel in a fixed time and similar speeds, the deeper profilers would have to make fewer dives due to their limitations. 

	The next piece of this analysis is focusing on the SSP as the season changes. Given the theory that we learned in class, I would assume that the thermocline would move closer to the surface during the winter, which would mean that the minimum speed of sound would move closer to the surface. Below is raw data that shows ssp relative to the depth of various locations in both summer and winter.
 
 
 
 
	The first location has heavily scattered data which is hard to read, but the next set of locations appears to show that the profile in summer could end up with a lower speed of sound than the profiler in winter. Over the same distance, the winter profiler got to around 1485m/s, but the profiler in summer looks like it could go below 1480m/s if the profiler went deeper. This matches what I predicted prior to looking at the data.
	The third piece of analysis looks at how the ssp changes as the day goes on. This part I don’t expect much to be shown in the data, as things like day to day weather may have greater effect than just the lack of sunlight. If there was constant weather, I would imagine that we would get similar temperature effects that were found in the second part of this analysis given that the heat source that is constantly warming the surface would be absent for half of the day. Below are some off the ssp against time graphs. 
 
 
	The best example of the change in speed of sound comes from the Coastal Endurance Oregon Offshore Cabled Shallow Profiler Mooring in Winter. Looking closely at the peak speeds of sound, it appears that the are smaller peaks when the sun is out, which is what we would expect in a location that has a consistent climate and reasonable day and night cycles.
 
	The final analysis looks at how the location affects the ssp. Provided below is a map of the locations that are being discussed in this report. The axial array is both further offshore and at a higher latitude than the Oregon sampling point. Given their locations, the axial array would be expected to have colder average temperatures, and thus a higher minimum speed of sound.

	Looking at the two graphs above, there appears to be a match with my prediction. The Oregon Array appears to continue to drop the speed of sound as it gets to 200m, whereas the axial array appears to begin increasing in the recorded speed of sound at only 150m.
